              I'm Sharad Raj Aryal, a passionate and driven student of Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, currently pursuing my BSc (Hons) at Coventry University. Born and raised in Biratnagar, Nepal, my journey has been shaped by a blend of curiosity for technology and a deep commitment to personal growth and community impact.

              From a young age, I've believed in the power of technology to drive change. This belief has been central to my academic and professional pursuits. I've collaborated with friends on various projects, such as starting a blogging website, theblogbyte.com. My entrepreneurial spirit also led me to co-run a successful dropshipping business in Biratnagar, which helped fund my college education.

              Professionally, I've worked across various industries, gaining hands-on experience and broadening my skill set. As a Warehouse Operative at Poundland, I learned the importance of efficiency, teamwork, and attention to detail in fast-paced environments. I've also gained valuable customer service and organizational skills from my work as a waiter.

            <p className="text-lg">
              My passion for technology is at the core of my work. I've had the privilege of building websites for several businesses, including authenticbite.shop, authenticconstruct.com, and bunchi.co.uk. Through these projects, I've helped businesses establish a robust online presence and expand their reach through successful social media strategies and marketing campaigns.

            <p className="text-lg">
              Beyond my professional accomplishments, I've always remained committed to giving back to the community. As a former member of the Nepal Child Club in Biratnagar, I actively participated in various social initiatives, including organizing fundraisers for the victims of the 2015 Nepal earthquake, flood-affected families, and individuals battling cancer.

            <p className="text-lg">
              I'm driven by a desire to continuously learn and grow, both personally and professionally. Whether it's diving deeper into AI research, designing user-centered websites, or launching impactful marketing campaigns, I approach every project with curiosity and determination.
